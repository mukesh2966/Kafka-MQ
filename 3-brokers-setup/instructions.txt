This folder contains the yaml files for kafka cluster(1 zookeeper and 3 broker). And also the python consumer and producer.

The mentioned setup is for setting up 3 borker and 1 zookeeper in kubernetes, without the authentication, encryption and authorization part.(these are explored in the setup provided in kube-demo folder)

First we need to deploy all the services(for both zookeeper and all brokers).
The kafka services will allocate us the corresponding public IPs.
Then change the advertised listerners IP in the broker0.yaml,broker1.yaml,broker2.yaml files to the newly allocated public IP.

Also, place that public IP(s) in bootstrap server's argument in both consumer and producer file.
    
Then first launch the zookeeper deployment.
After that the kafka deployment.

This should complete the setup and the producer and cosumer script would be functional from your system.
(for producer and consumer scripts, we have used kafka-python dependency. So, install that in your system before running the producer and consumer scripts)
