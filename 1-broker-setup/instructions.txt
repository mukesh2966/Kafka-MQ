This folder contains the yaml files for zookeeper and broker deployment. And also the python consumer and producer.

The mentioned setup is for setting up 1 borker and 1 zookeeper in kubernetes, without the authentication, encryption and authorization part.(these are explored in the setup provided in kube-demo folder)

First we need to deploy both the services.
The kafka service will allocate us the public IP.
Then change the advertised listerners IP in the kafkaDeploy.yaml file to the newly allocated public IP.
Also, place that public IP in bootstrap server's argument in both consumer and producer file.
    
Then first launch the zookeeper deployment.
After that the kafka deployment.

This should complete the setup and the producer and cosumer script would be functional from your system.
(for producer and consumer scripts, we have used kafka-python dependency. So, install that in your system before running the producer and consumer scripts)
